created this file

git add gittest.txt
git commit

I created a repository on github called SimpleTest, but then from local I did

git remote add  https://github.com/cgarai/NewTest.git
I did this because I was wondering if I could make a repo on github from
local.   It didn't appear
git remote add  https://github.com/cgarai/Simpletest.git

now git remote -v shows  https://github.com/cgarai/NewTest.git

      fatal: repository xxxx not found

Commit here

Found on stackexchange that .git/config

[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/cgarai/NewTest.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = https://github.com/cgarai/Simpletest.git
	merge = refs/heads/master

I changed NewTest to Simpletest and it worked.

Now I'm adding changes on the master via GitHub editor.
I had created a branch 'alt' before making this edit.
