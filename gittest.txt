I created a repository on github called SimpleTest, but then from local I did

git remote add  https://github.com/cgarai/NewTest.git
I did this because I was wondering if I could make a repo on github from
local.   It didn't appear
git remote add  https://github.com/cgarai/Simpletest.git

now git remote -v shows  https://github.com/cgarai/NewTest.git

      fatal: repository xxxx not found
